# RPS
The app is for playing the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer opponent. It is developed with the objective of implementing Q-learning, the reinforcement learning algorithm, to improve opponent's decision-making and make it more challenging for the user to win.





I am developing an Android app, and when I press the play button, I encounter the following error: "java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{com.upb.st.rps3/com.upb.st.rps3.GameActivity}: java.lang.IllegalStateException: SavedStateRegistry was already restored." I am not sure why this error is occurring and how to resolve it. I have tried searching online but could not find a solution that works for me.
